# makeBinaryWrapper

This is me just trying different things and seeing what I personally like at this point.

The solution that seems best for nixpkgs is `--add-flag` and `--append-flag` arguments being added,
and the existing `--add-flags` and `--append-flags` arguments being left unchanged.

But I still am having fun with this script so, this is still here.
